				Abuse, Trauma & PTSD
			</h2>
			<p class="copy">
				For survivors of emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse and those who have experienced other traumatic 
				events in their lives, pain, anger and shame may be difficult emotions to escape, and can make day-to-day 
				living extremely difficult.
			</p>
			<p class="copy">
				Alexandra uses a client-led approach when working with individuals who have experienced trauma. She works 
				gently and compassionately to co-create a safe space for clients to begin to process what happened to them
				and its effect on their lives.

				Depression & Anxiety
			</h2>
			<p class="copy">
				Feeling low, lonely and hopeless are all signs that it may be helpful to talk to someone about what you 
				are going through, but this first step can seem very daunting. Likewise, many of us suffer from anxiety 
				in our day to day lives which may make life a constant battle. We may have safety behaviours that we have 
				to complete in order to keep our anxiety at bay and avoid panic taking over, or have a sense of dread and 
				not understand why.
			</p>
			<p class="copy">
				Alexandra will help you to talk through how you are feeling and think with you about these feelings  
				in relation to the rest of your life. She will work with you to tailor the type of therapy you wish to
				receive. This may mean spending time exploring the possible origins or root of feelings of depression and
				anxiety, or it may mean creating a formulation of the problem together and making a plan for how to, for 
				example, reduce safety behaviours or become more active.

				Family, Relationships & Interpersonal Problems
			</h2>
			<p class="copy">
				Many of us may have grown up with challenging family dynamics, and this in turn might have had a long lasting 
				repercussions on our lives even today. Others of us might feel that we have always had strong bonds with family
				and loved ones, yet negotiating the demands and pressures of relationships can often be difficult. 

			</p>
			<p class="copy">
				Very often in our relationships, the love and care we receive is conditional on our acting or being a particular 
				version of ourselves for others. Alexandra will provide an environment of non-judgement and acceptance where you 
				will have the freedom to explore the impact of the relationships you are concerned about. Having a space that is 
				just for you is an empowering step towards breaking unwanted patterns in our relationships and thinking about them 
				from new perspectives.
