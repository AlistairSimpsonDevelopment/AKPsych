				My Approach
			</h2>
			<p class="copy">
				As a psychologist, Alexandra’s approach begins with an attitude of warmth,
				responsiveness and kindness. She uses collaborative enquiry to help clients
				to gain a greater understanding and insight into their problems.
			</p>
			<p class="copy">
				Alexandra is very aware that each client’s journey to counselling is particular
				to them. We may have a sense of being alone, feel hopeless, guilty or overwhelmed,
				but we might find it hard to pinpoint what in particular brought us here.
				Alternatively we may know exactly why we are here, but not have a clue what to do about it.
			</p>
			<p class="copy">
				Alexandra’s approach recognises how different each person’s experience is and addresses
				this by taking an integrative approach to counselling. Drawing on her clinical expertise
				in humanistic, psychodynamic and cognitive behavioural therapies, she tailors therapy to
				clients’ unique needs and requirements.
