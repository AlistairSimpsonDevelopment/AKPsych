						<strong>Every journey is different</strong>
						</h3>
							<p class="copy text-right">
								Alexandra is very aware that each client’s journey to counselling is particular
								to them. We may have a sense of being alone, feel hopeless, guilty or overwhelmed,
								but we might find it hard to pinpoint what in particular brought us here.
								Alternatively we may know exactly why we are here, but not have a clue what to do about it.

							<h3>
							<strong>		Tailored to your needs</strong>
							</h3>
							<p class="copy text-left">
								Alexandra’s approach recognises how different each person’s experience is and addresses
								this by taking an integrative approach to counselling. Drawing on her clinical expertise
								in humanistic, psychodynamic and cognitive behavioural therapies, she tailors therapy to
								clients’ unique needs and requirements.
